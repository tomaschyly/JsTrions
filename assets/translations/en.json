I wanted to test Flutter on desktop platforms and I got annoyed by manually working with json translations. I also liked the idea of app analyzing my code and finding translations, so I created this app.\n\nIf you have any issues with the app, UI or have ideas for improvement, please use the feedback form below. Thank you!",
